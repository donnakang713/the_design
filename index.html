          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>The client believes that the cloud storage market is still young and that there is room for another player. I was assigned to design a new cloud storage application that not only exhibits the the basic cloud storage features, but also has special features that allow users to share content with friends, family, and co-workers. The product must be unique from other current applications.</p>

        <h5>Problem</h5>
        <li>“The font used in the main headings looks fun, but maybe not as professional."</li>
        <li>"Main heading of the hero section covers the woman’s eyes in the background picture."</li>
        <li>“Too much space between logo and ‘Log In’ and ’Sign Up’ buttons. Looks awkward."</li>
        <li>“Would like to see the laptop and iphone view slightly bigger”.</li>
        <li>“Under ‘What makes Space so special?’ There is too much unnecessary white space.”</li>
        <li>“Testimonial section - the users’ photos are too small and rounding the corners of the background container looks childish.”</li>
      </ol>
      <ol style="1" class=result2>
        <h5>Solution</h5>
        <li>I changed the main heading fonts to from Nunito to Avenir Next for a more professional and modern vibe.</li>
        <li>In the hero section, I re-arranged the main heading so that it does not cover the woman’s eyes in the background picture.</li>
        <li>In the hero section, I included additional clickable links (About, Features, Pricing, etc.) to remove the unwanted space.</li>
        <li>Enlarged the laptop and iphone view so users can clearly see the preview of the product.</li>
        <li>Under the ‘What makes Space so special’, I aligned the paragraghs & icons in the same row to avoid unnecessary white space.</li>
        <li>Testimonial section - I shaped the background container so that it covers the entire space and has no rounded corners for a more modern look. I also re-sized the users’ photos.</li>

        <li>I removed containers around ‘Quick access’ and ‘Categories’, which removed a lot of unnecessary white space.</li>
        <li>I reduced size of the plus icon and aligned it with the text ‘Categories’.</li>

        <li>I changed the drop down menu under ’School Work’ to a drop down menu of list of other categories, so that users can easily navigate between different categories.</li>
        <li>I included a directory path My Space > School Work. Users know that they are currently in School Work category and can easily go back to My Space.</li>
