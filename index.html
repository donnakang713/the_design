          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>The client believes that the cloud storage market is still young and that there is room for another player. I was assigned to design a new cloud storage application that not only exhibits the the basic cloud storage features, but also has special features that allow users to share content with friends, family, and co-workers. The product must be unique from other current applications.</p>

          <p>When it comes to creating a great product, itâ€™s all about the users. I created a user survey to better understand my potential users and their opinions on cloud storage applications. The goal of the survey was to find out the following: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>In what situations do users use cloud storage apps?</li>
            <li>Which brand is their most favorite and why?</li>

          <p>To find out how Space can stand out from existing competition, I performed a competitive analysis on the following potential competitors below. What are these three businesses doing right and wrong? I used this knowledge to find out how Space can effectively position itself amongst big powerhouse companies and smaller dedicated companies.</p>
