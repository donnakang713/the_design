          <h2><b>Problem</b></h2>
          <p>The client believes that the cloud storage market is still young and that there is room for another player. I was assigned to design a new cloud storage application that not only exhibits the the basic cloud storage features, but also has special features that allow users to share content with friends, family, and co-workers. They wanted to introduce a product that is unique from other current applications.</p>

          <h2>User Survey</h2>
          <p>When it comes to creating a great product, itâ€™s all about the users. I created a user survey to better understand my potential users and their opinions on cloud storage applications. The goal of the survey was to find out the following: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>In what situations do users use cloud storage apps?</li>
            <li>Which brand is their most favorite and why?</li>
            <li>What features do users like when using cloud storage apps?</li>
            <li>What frustrations do users experience with cloud storage apps?</li>
            <li>What additional features do users like to see?</li>
            <li>Demographics info: User's profession, age range, and location</li>

          <p>After analyzing my results from previous steps, I moved forward with creating user stories and user flows. I selected 4 user stories to highlight the main features of the application and converted them into user flows to show how the user would interact with the application.</p>
