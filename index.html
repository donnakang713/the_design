          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>The client believes that the cloud storage market is still young and that there is room for another player. I was assigned to design a new cloud storage application that not only exhibits the the basic cloud storage features, but also has special features that allow users to share content with friends, family, and co-workers. The product must be unique from other current applications.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>In what situations do users use cloud storage apps?</li>
            <li>Which brand is their most favorite and why?</li>

          <p>To find out how Space can stand out from existing competition, I performed a competitive analysis on the following potential competitors below.

          <h5>Problem</h5>
          <li>“Users profile photos appear too big.”</li>
          <li>“How can I navigate back to ‘School Work’ view? Include a directory path.”</li>
          <li>“Microsoft word already has its own commenting features. I suggest making a word document version for Space.”</li>
          <li>“How do you know which line in the text the users’ comment is referring to?”</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="1" class=result4>
          <h5>Solution</h5>
          <li>I re-sized the users profile photos as is was too big.</li>
          <li>I included a directory path My Space > School Work > Survey Notes. Users know that they are currently in Survey Notes and can easily go back to School Work or My Space.</li>
          <li>I made a Space version of word document, instead of using Microsoft Word.</li>
          <li>To comment, users can highlight the text and right click to insert comment. Once posted, the comment will show up on the right side next to the text, which will highlighted.</li>

          <h2>Branding & Identity</h2>
          <p>I wanted to leave a positive, friendly, professional, and modern vibe for Space. I also wanted to let the users know that Space is reliable, safe, and user-friendly. Here is what I did for the branding and identity.</p>

          <h4 class=brand>Logo Design</h4>
          <p>Space’s logo includes a simple wordmark and icon. Notice the bold lines of the cube-shaped logo make up the “S” in Space. Nunito is a  fun, friendly, and a bold script typeface. All together, the logo embodies characticteristics of a <span class=logo2>safe, simple, friendly, organized, and modern,</span> cloud space for everyone.</p>

          <p>Pairing Nunito with Avenir Next work perfectly together especially with contrasting sizes. This set of typefaces best respresent the positive and friendly feel of the brand with a more modern and professional vibe.</p>

          <h4 class=brand>Color Palette</h4>
          <p>Space’s color palette is fairly minimal. Navy is ideal for design showing that it is professionaI and reliable. This is used as interactive elements and as background colors. Dark grayish red color work perfectly well together with the navy . This color is ideal for design to attract attention and is used as text colors. Gray and white is used as some icon, text, and background colors.</p>

          <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
          <p>Space was my first design project and it was an incredible learning experience for me. Here are my key takeaways:</p>
            <ol style="1" class=keylearning>
              <li><span class=key>Don’t underestimated the power of the design process.</span> As a UX designer, I should not overlook the initial steps in design process, such as conducting user research and personas, as it sets a clearer vision for my project.</li>
              <li><span class=key>Branding is not always about the visuals.</span> Good branding inhabits every aspect of the way a company markets their product. It can influence our potential users. I had to consider what kind of message I want to portray to the audience.</li>
              <li><span class=key>When in doubt, ask the users.</span> There were many instances during the project, where I spent hours figuring out the best designs. Instead of focusing on my own personal preferences, I learned to ask for users' feedback right away. Conducting user tests and preference tests was a vital part of the project.</li>
              <li><span class=key>Sometimes, less is more.</span> Less is more when less does more. The use of negative space and getting rid of repetitive features led to a simple and user-friendly interface.</li>
